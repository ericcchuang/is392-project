# is392-project
## Members: 
    - Allan Breslov (Encoding Categorical Columns)
    - Eric Huang (Split the data into training and testing sets)
    - Jonathan Ocampo (Visualization)
    - Eric Vargas (Model Training)
    - Josh Mantilla (Metrics)
    
## Expected Outputs:
The completed project should output:
    - Encoded DataFrame head to verify categorical encoding.
    - Training and testing data heads.
    - Visualizations
    - R2 Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, polynoimal, and Lasso Regression models.
## To run:
    - import all dependences from requirements.txt
    - run with 'pyhton index.py'
	
### Known Issues & Next Steps:
	- Code for Decision Tree model training does not work since data is too large (30,000 entries) needs to be tested with lower amount
	- Code for metric analysis for Dbies-Bouldin Index will be re-added once Decision Tree model is made since it does nothing
	- Visualization has not been added yet must be added
